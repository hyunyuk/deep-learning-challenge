 Module 21 Challenge

 # Overview of the Analysis
Module 21 was about the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wanting a tool to help select applicants that has a better chance for success in their ventures. Therefore, using machine learning we will create a binary classifier that can predict which applications will be sucessful if chosen. 

# Results

## Data Processing



## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### Neural Network
- Contained three layers
- Generated a total of 6461 parameters
- Accuracy was roughly 73% which is slightly less than the desired 75%

### Optimization Neural Network
- The only change in the second attempt was adding "NAME" back in the dataset.
- Contained three layers
- Generated a total of 38701 parameters
- Accuracy was roughly 79% which is over the desired 75%
